## More quantifiers!

Hi, I think that “most of” refers to amounts above half of something, for example, “Most of the male who works in this company is 30 years old or less”. On the other hand, when we use “some of” refers to amounts below 25% or a little bit about something, or a part of something, for example, "Some of the children prefer to play the piano than a guitar ".

> Most of is like 75% of something which is much
Some of is like 25% of something is just a little part of something.

**What is the difference between “most of” and “some of”?
**

Both terms are use to quantify of a specific group.

“Most of” refers to majority of a group. More than a half.
Example: Most of us at Platzi like challenges. 💪

“Some of” refers to a small percentage of a group. About twenty five percent.
Example: Only some of my friends want to study English. 😕

To me the difference between "most of" and "some of" is:

“Most of” means the largest in number or amount, while
"Some of" means “an amount of” or “a number of”, when the amount or number is not given.

We’re saying that the 75-80% of that group of people enjoyed the trip.

Most of the youngers in my city are billingual, that’s the reason why we have many call center in English here.
