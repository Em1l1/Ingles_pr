Listen to the dialogue. Put the verbs in the correct category.

What did I do on my summer holiday? Well, I decided to stay home and have a ‚Äústaycation‚Äù. I had a lot of free time, so I relaxed and watched movies with my family, I walked in the park with my dogs and I even painted my room! I visited my friend Susan one day. We played tennis and cooked dinner. I also started an online course and I‚Äôm so happy because I‚Äôve learned so much. I loved my staycation! It was really fun and I definitely saved more money than I expected.
