**Ordinal numbers**We add the suffix TH to most of the cardinal numbers to transform them to ordinal numbers. There are some exceptions and in those cases we use the suffixes ST, ND, RD. Check the examples below and be careful with spelling.

**Example**

Hi John. You have really good pronunciation. It is a powerful thing to improve listening when we are studying the English language.

About the language learning with videos. I think that makes artificial language immersion can contribute to learning fast and easily. And then, with a high-quality class like that, if you are in the basic level and use that video. You can use the close caption subtitle in “Subtitle settings”. When you don´t know some words, you can stop the video and the first step is to try to understand it in the context. The second step is finding the mining on an English dictionary like WordReference. The final step is to translate the word and the complete sentence in an online translator like Google Translate or Deepl.

Asking a partner or the teacher to describe some word that you know in Spanish but not in English is another powerful way. When you describe the thing, you build in your mind a really strong image of that. When someone tells you the name of that thing, you had built a strong connection between the mining image and the word, and will be very difficult to forget that.

My final advice is to use Grammarly. Write complete sentences and later look up the mistakes. With that online App, you must receive real-time feedback. Repeat those activities every day like a complement of Platzi´s courses.
