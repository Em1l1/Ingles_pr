## Grammar: Use of different types of verbs

ere are different types of verb forms:

- To + be
- Verb + ing
- Modal + verb

Los verbos modales son verbos auxiliares que no pueden funcionar como un verbo principal, a diferencia de los verbos auxiliares “be”, “do” y “have” que sí pueden funcionar como un verbo principal.

Los verbos modales expresan modalidad, habilidad, posibilidad, necesidad u otra condición. Los utilizamos para el futuro y el condicional.

Como verbos complementarios que son, los verbos modales no funcionan sin otro verbo. Este otro verbo siempre va después del verbo modal y está en la forma base (el infinitivo sin “to”). No se conjugan los verbos modales y no tienen tiempo.

Los verbos modales son:
can
could
may
might
will
shall
should
ought to
must/have to
would

EL gerundio** (ING)** se usa para tiempos** continuos **, es decir, acciones que estaba haciendo o estoy haciendo

De la misma forma hay **verbos** que **siempre** van a ir con **ING** como son :

enjoy( disfrutar) I enjoy going to the cinema.
finish( terminar) I finished studying and then went to the pub.
imagine( imaginar) Can you imagine living in that palace?
mind( importar)Do you mind helping me with this bag?
suggest( sugerir)She suggests going to bed an hour earlier.
avoid (evitar) If I were you, I’d avoid going that way - there’s loads of traffic!
spent(pasar tiempo) She spends time uploading photos to the internet.

**Different types of verbs form in simple present:**

1. To + Verb:

After preposition “to”, the “verb” goes in the base form.
Example: We like to spend time with our friends.

1. Verb + ing:

Here is the “verb in the base form” and next other “verb with the gerund -ing-”.
Example: They enjoy waking up early.

- Additional note: Using this form with: enjoy, hate, like, love. These verbs can be follow bey “ing” form of the verb. **Enjoy** particularly is always follow by the “ing” form of the next verb.

1. modal + verb:

It´s “modal verb” follow by other "verb in th base form"
Example: You can go to gym in the morning.
-Additional note: Always when we have a modal verb the following verb has to be in the base form.

## Grammar: Difference between simple present and present continuous

We use the simple present to talk about things that happen all the time

We use the present continuous to talk about things that are happening right now
Structure

- Subject + verb be + verb ing + complement (Positive)
- Subject + verb be + not + verb ing + complement (Negative)
- Verb be + subject + verb ing + complement + ? (Question)

**Example**

- **Simple Present**: I study English in Platzi
- **Present Continuous**: I’m studing English in Platzi right now.

I’d like contribute about Present Continuos.
We use PC when too:

- We talk about trends. For example: Today the vegetarian’s market is rising.
- We want criticing something or someone. For example:
  He’s always explaining me really basic things that I already know. It’s annoying!

Present continuous is used as future tense when We want to say plans previously arragment like a appointment with doctor, etc. If it’s not specific plan we use Will or Going To form.

Some examples:

I’m starting my homework tomorrow in the morning.
I’m seeing with school principal at 7 pm to talk about my scholarship.
