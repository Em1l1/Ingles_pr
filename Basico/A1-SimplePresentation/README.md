## Irregular plural nouns

They are some plural words that are irregular, so, they dont have a ‚ÄúS‚Äù at the final of the verb, like the most. In some cases, just adds another letter besides a ‚ÄúS‚Äù. Like:
Hero -> Hero**e**s
In other cases, the letters changes completly, and sound diferrent, like:
Foot -> Feet
Tooth -> Teeth
Mouse -> Mice

Fish is an special case, or i would say, these words that describes a determined number of animals of the same kind, the plural word doesnt change. Example:
1 fish -> 10 fish. ( If they are the same Species)

If they are different, you could say:
‚ÄúI have ten differente types of fishes on my Aquarium.‚Äù

## Irregular plural nouns

These are nouns that make their plural form in an irregular way. That means that you don‚Äôt use the letter ‚ÄúS‚Äù to form the plural, but instead it‚Äôs actually a different word or a different spelling.

Man - Men

Woman - Women

Life - Lives

Child - Children

Tooth - Teeth

Foot - Feet

Sheep - Sheep

Mouse - Mice

Goose - Geese

Ox - Oxen

Fish - Fish

Deer - Deer

Cactus - Cacti

## Verbs in imperative form

We use this structure when we want to give instructions, when we want to give orders or adive. For instance, instructions.

- Please go to the resource section. -Instruction
- Don‚Äôt do that. -Order
- Go in the morning. -Recomendation

We don‚Äôt mention the pronouns (I, You, He, She, It). We only say the action (Go, Do, Practice)

## And vs. but

AND

- I like Resident Evil and Silent Hill games.
- I have a laptop and a monitor.
- I love to develop projects and play video games.
- She is going to buy a bag and a dress
- He hates onion and pineapple

BUT

- I don‚Äôt have a cat but I have a dog
- She doesn‚Äôt have a new dress but she has a new bag
- I want to go to Argentina but I don‚Äôt have enough money
- They studied all night but they failed the test

3. I dislike Facebook but I like Twitter.
4. I meditate everyday but I‚Äôd like to do yoga too.
5. I read news on Twitter but I miss to read on the paper.gg

## A vs. An

We use A and An when we want to talk about something general or that it‚Äôs not particular or very specific.

An: When the next word starts with a vowel.

A: When the next word starts with a consonant sound.

It‚Äôs the sound and not the letter, because we have some exceptions

- We say a University, because the ‚Äúu‚Äù sounds like ‚Äúyour‚Äù
- We say an Hour, because the ‚Äúh‚Äù is silent.

Practice:

- There is **a** black marker on the table.
- She‚Äôs reading **an** old book.
- She is **a** pilot.
- See you in **an** hour.
- I don‚Äôt have time for **a** movie tonight.
